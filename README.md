# National-Space-Day-2025

ðŸš€ Space Tourism 2047 â€“ National Space Day Special

Project type: PictoBlox Block Coding Animation

Theme: National Space Day 2025

Concept: Space Tourism in the year 2047 (futuristic vision)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is an animated simulation built in PictoBlox to visualize the concept of commercial space tourism in the near future. Inspired by National Space Day, it imagines a world where traveling from Earth to the Moon and back is as common as flying between countries.

The animation features a Moon surface scene where multiple sprites (Earth, spacecraft, and an additional spacecraft) interact to depict the idea of two-way space travel. Text overlays give a tourism-like promotional feel, inviting viewers to imagine booking their own lunar holiday.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Celebrate National Space Day through creative coding.

Demonstrate PictoBlox animation capabilities for storytelling.

Represent the concept of space tourism in an engaging and futuristic style.

Showcase Earth â†’ Moon â†’ Earth round trips using animated sprites.

ðŸ›° Features

Moon Surface Background â€“ Creates an authentic lunar landscape for the animation.

Sprites:

--- Earth â€“ Rotating/animated to give a dynamic appearance.

--- Spacecraft â€“ Moves toward the Moon to represent the first leg of the journey.

--- Spacecraft1 â€“ Represents a return trip, traveling from the Moon back to Earth.

--- Bidirectional Movement â€“ Simulates to-and-fro space travel.

--- Futuristic Text Banners:

ðŸš€ SPACE TOURISM 2047 ðŸš€

"Experience the Future of Space Travel!"

"Beautiful Earth - Home to 8 billion people!"

"See Earth from space â€“ Book your tour today!"

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

PictoBlox â€“ Block-based coding environment for creating animations and interactive projects.

Sprite Assets â€“ Custom/stock images of Earth, Moon surface, and spacecraft.

Motion & Looks Blocks â€“ Used for movement, rotation, and text display.

ðŸ–¥ How It Works

Background Setup â€“ Moon surface set as the main backdrop.

Sprite Initialization â€“ Earth placed in the distance, spacecraft near starting positions.

Forward Journey â€“ First spacecraft moves from Earth toward the Moon.

Return Journey â€“ Second spacecraft travels from the Moon back to Earth.

Text Display â€“ Promotional messages appear at key points in the animation.

Loop/Replay â€“ Animation repeats for continuous viewing.
